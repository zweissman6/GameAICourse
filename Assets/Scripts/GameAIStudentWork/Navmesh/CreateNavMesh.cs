            // to a data structure that you are iterating over. A slightly more efficient
            // alternative would be to make dedicated add and delete lists and apply them
            // after enumeration is complete.

            //      and mapping CommonPolygonEdges to path node indexes (ints)
            //
            // For 1.), You can add the end points of the edges together and divide by 2.
            // 2.) is a bit more challenging. I recommend the use of Dictionaries for the mappings.
